    In older JavaScript (ES2019 and earlier), class fields were handled with
    simple assignments within the constructor. However, in newer JavaScript
    versions (ES2022), the standard for class fields changed to use
    Object.defineProperty(). Setting this to true prevents a common class
    inheritance bug.

    This is only needed for our application code as Node.js has had native
    support for the modern Object.defineProperty() behavior for class fields for
    a long time. Therefore, there is no need to transpile the class fields in
    your vite.config.ts file.
