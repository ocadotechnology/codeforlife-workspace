# Service

Code for Life follows the microservices architecture. For each service within our application, there are a number of patterns and conventions we follow that must be adhered to.

The core service, which acts as users' entry point into our app, is our portal service. Therefore, it's advised to look there to get a general sense of how our services should be structured.

Each service repo is broken down into 2 directories:

- [backend](./backend)
- [frontend](./frontend)
